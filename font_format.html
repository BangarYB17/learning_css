    <p class="f_family">Although the area around Pune has history going back millennia, 
        the more recent history of the city is closely related to the
        rise of the Maratha empire from the 17th–18th century. Pune 
        first came under Maratha control in the early 1600s when Maloji
        Bhosale was granted fiefdom of Pune by the Nizam Shahi of Ahmednagar.
        When Maloji's son, Shahaji had to join campaigns in distant southern
        India for the Adil Shahi sultanate, he selected Pune for the residence 
        of his wife, Jijabai and younger son, Shivaji (1630-1680), 
        the future founder of the Maratha empire.[1] Although Shivaji 
         spent part of his childhood and teenage years in Pune, 
        the actual control of the Pune region shifted between the 
        Bhosale family of Shivaji, the Adil Shahi dynasty, and the Mughals.</p>
    
    <p class="f_family2">in the early 1700s, Pune and its surrounding areas were granted to the newly
       appointed Maratha Peshwa, Balaji Vishwanath by Chhatrapati Shahu, grandson
       of Shivaji. Balaji Vishwanath's son, and successor as the Peshwa, Bajirao
       I made Pune as his seat of administration. This spurred growth in the city
       during Bajirao's rule which was continued by his descendants for the best 
       part of 18th century. The city was a political and commercial center of the
        Indian subcontinent during that period.[2] This
       period came to an end with the Marathas losing to the British East India
        Company during the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818.</p>

       control shifted between the Bhonsle family, the Adil Shahi dynasty,
       and the Mughals, for most of the century. In the early 1700s, Pune 
       and its surrounding areas were granted to the newly appointed Maratha Peshwa, Balaji Vishwanath. 
       It remained with his family until his great-grandson Bajirao II was
       defeated by the British East India Company in 1818.</p>
