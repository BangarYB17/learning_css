    <p class="t_indent t_line_height t_transform_uppercase">During the Rashtrakuta dynasty, the city was referred to as Punnaka and Punyapur.
         The copper plates of 758 and 768 CE show that the Yadava dynasty had renamed the city as 
         Punakavishaya and Punya Vishaya. 'Vishaya' means land, while 'Punaka' and 'Punya' mean holy.
         The city was known as Kasbe Pune when under the command of Maratha king Shivaji's father, Shahaji. 
         Mughal emperor Aurangzeb renamed a small neighbourhood in central part of the old city as 
         Muhiyabad (the only divergent naming) some time between 1703 and 1705 in memory of his great-grandson Muhi-ul-Milan, 
         who died there. The name Muhiyabad was reverted soon after Aurangzeb's death.[15]
         Anglicized to Poona in 1857 by the English during British rule, the city's name was changed to Pune in 1978.</p>
