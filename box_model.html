     <p class="simple">Pune first came under Maratha control in the early 1600s. However, 
       control shifted between the Bhonsle family, the Adil Shahi dynasty,
       and the Mughals, for most of the century. In the early 1700s, Pune 
       and its surrounding areas were granted to the newly appointed Maratha Peshwa, Balaji Vishwanath. 
       It remained with his family until his great-grandson Bajirao II was
       defeated by the British East India Company in 1818.</p>
